# Starter code for all datasets of Data Shop Canton Zurich

💡 Have you ever **wished to open any dataset in a data portal with one click and get a fully configured Python Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown file – with all metadata, descriptions, data links, and some starter code?**

This is an experiment to provide exactly this.

With this repo you get starter code for **all CSV datasets** (currently {{ DATASET_COUNT }}) that are available in the [Data Shop of the Statistical Office of Canton Zurich](https://www.zh.ch/de/politik-staat/opendata.zhweb-noredirect.zhweb-cache.html?keywords=ogd#/).

In the list below, you will find links to preconfigured code files so that you **can immediately start analyzing the data with R or Python.**

**The Jupyter Notebooks can be opened directly in Google Colab.** 🚀

Feedback is always very welcome – simply open an issue.

⚠️ **Note**: To download individual files from GitHub, you need to switch to the file's `RAW` view and then `Right-Click-Save-As`. This way you get the proper file format rather than the HTML that GitHub yields.

For all data licenses, please refer to each dataset's link or the metadata API endpoint provided [here](https://www.zh.ch/de/politik-staat/opendata.zhweb-noredirect.zhweb-cache.html?keywords=ogd#/datasets/1461@fachstelle-ogd-kanton-zuerich).
